// use an object to execute promises one by one
betch({
  r1: Promise.resolve(1),
  r2: (ctx, data) => Promise.resolve(data + 2),
  r3: (ctx, data) => data + 3
}).
then((data) => {
  console.log(data) // data should be 6
})

// or use array to execute promises with parallel mode
betch([
  Promise.resolve(1),
  Promise.resolve(2),
  Promise.resolve(3)
]).
then((data) => {
  console.log(data) // data should be [1, 2, 3]
})
```

### aq

  })

// read an file
const path = require('path')
const file = path.join(__dirname, 'test.dat')

aq.
  readFile(file, { encoding: 'utf-8' }).
  then((data) => {
    console.log(data) // output file content
  })

// invoke rest method
aq.
  rest("http://127.0.0.1:8080/?key1=val1&key2=val2").
  then((data) => {
    console.log(data) // output the response body by web api
